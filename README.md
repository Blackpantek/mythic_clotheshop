# Mythic Clotheshop
This is a rather simple clotheshop script that was built for Mythic Framework.

Dependencies :

- [NativeUILua - Reloaded](https://github.com/iTexZoz/NativeUILua_Reloaded)
- [Mythic Notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify)
- Mythic Base - NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED


This also contains the closet script that is used in the Mythic Apartment release

>NOTE: As with most MythicRP releases at this point, this has several calls to Mythic Framework resources that have not (and may not) released publicly. This is intended as a **dev resource** at most and not a simple drag & drop to use on public servers. **Do not make any issues asking for it to be made to work on a public framework or why it isn't plug n' play.**
